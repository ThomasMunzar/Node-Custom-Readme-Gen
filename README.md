## Description

This project uses Node.js and NPM inquirer to create a ReadMe Generator from the comfort of the users terminal.  This project helped me learn more about Node.js as well as NPM's and all the different types that there are.  Inquirer is a very useful tool, even though this just makes a readme, the methods of this project open up a whole new way that I as a engineer can interact with users and their input.  

## Installation

User MUST have Node.js and NPM inquirer installed.

## Usage

Node.js and  NPM Inquirer - are the languages used in this project

here is a link to a video of the ReadMe Generator in action:
